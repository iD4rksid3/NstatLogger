# NstatLogger

NstatLogger or netstat logger is a multi platform (Windows/ Linux) python3 script that can be used as DFIR tool which will log all uniq communications from a host with the following info:

  - Proto
  - Local address:port
  - Remote address:port
  - Status
  - PID
  - Program name
  - Time started
  - Command line
  
The tool can later be used to perform reverse IP lookup (using system dns) and get more info using one of the following:
  - Retrieve dns history of an IP through [Threat Crowd API](https://github.com/AlienVault-OTX/ApiV2) which is recommended as it is passively collect data (without connecting to the remote addresses).
  - Retrieve SSL alternative names through the use of python modules (pyopenssl, requests) which will connect to each remote IP and get the list (it is more accurate, but its not a good practice when doing an investigation) use it if the passive approch doesn't get enough info, and use it behind proxy/vpn. 

### Dependencies:
The tool depends on the awsome [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) python module , [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module and [pyopenssl](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/).

### Installation:
Install the dependencies:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/id4rksid3/NstatLogger.git
$ cd NstatLogger
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or download the stand alone Windows exe file from [release](https://github.com/iD4rksid3/NstatLogger/releases).

### Usage:
The tool can run without administrator/root priviliage, but it will not be able to collect all the informtion
```sh
D:\NstatLogger.exe -h
#or
$ python3 NstatLogger.py -h

usage: NstatLogger [-h] [-r RESOLVE] [-t TIMER] [-i INTERVAL]
[+] Log netstat like TCP/IP and UDP connections from host
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RESOLVE, --resolve RESOLVE
                        Perform reverse IP lookup
  -t TIMER, --timer TIMER
                        Set timer in seconds of when to stop capturing,
                        default will run until user termination (ctrl+c)
  -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        Set capturing interval in seconds, default is 3
[+] Example: NstatLogger -i 2 -t 3600 (will run NstatLogger for one hour, with
2 seconds interval/refresh)
```
Example:
```
$ python3 NstatLogger.py -t 2000 -i 5 # will run the tool for 2000 seconds with a 5 second interval/refresh
# a NstatLogger-xxx-uniq.log file will be writen to current directory
$ python3 NstatLogger.py -r NstatLogger-xxx-Uniq.log # Performe reverse IP lookup on the output
```
..* Note: Output from -r (resolve) can get messy if dns history or ssl alternative names is huge.
### Use case:
Packet capture can get huge and looking for suspecious communication can get really tedious among all these legit packets, NetFlow traffic can be usefull but again as with packet capture we have no clue which process made that request which what this tool will try to solve, and of course this tool is no replacement for both of these great technologies, it's just a good quick way to start investigation.
